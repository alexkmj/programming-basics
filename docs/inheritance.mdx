# Inheritance

**Inheritance** is a concept in object-oriented programming that allows creating
new classes from existing classes. Inheritance enables the creation of new
classes (derived or child classes) that inherit the properties and behavior of
an existing class (base or parent class).

The derived class can reuse and extend the functionality of the base class, and
can add additional properties and methods specific to itself. This can
significantly reduce code duplication, increase code reuse, and make the code
more manageable and maintainable.

The parent class is also known as the super class, while the derived class is
also known as the sub class. The sub class is said to inherit the properties and
behaviors of the super class. The sub class can access the properties and
methods of the super class using the `super` keyword in many OOP languages.

Inheritance is a powerful concept in OOP, and is widely used in many programming
languages to build complex systems. It is an essential aspect of object-oriented
design that enables modular, reusable, and maintainable code.

# Base class

In this example, `Animal` is the parent class or super class while `Dog` is the
child class or sub class. The `eat()` method in `Dog` extends the `eat()` in
`Animal`. The `eat()` of `Animal` is called in `eat()` of `Dog` by calling the
`super.eat()`.

## Factory Methods

Factory methods is a design pattern in object-oriented programming that
provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but allow subclasses
to alter the type of objects that will be created. A factory method typically
defines an abstract method in the superclass, which the subclasses then
implement to create the desired objects.

The key advantage of using factory methods is that they provide a level of
abstraction between the client code and the creation of objects. This allows for
more flexibility in the creation process and makes the code more maintainable
and reusable.

For example, consider an interface `Vehicle` that has a factory method called
`start()`. The `start()` method is abstract and does not provide an
implementation. Subclasses of `Vehicle`, such as `Car` and `Truck`, would
then implement the `start()` method to create instances of their
respective classes. The `VehicleFactory` is then responsible for creating
instances of `Vehicle` based on the given type.

  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
public interface Vehicle {
    void start();
}

public class Car implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {

    }
}

public class Truck implements Vehicle {
    @Override
    public void start() {
        System.out.println("Starting Truck...");
    }
}

public class VehicleFactory {
    public static Vehicle createVehicle(String type) {
        if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("car")) {
            return new Car();
        } else if (type.equalsIgnoreCase("truck")) {
            return new Truck();
        } else {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid vehicle type: " + type);
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vehicle car = VehicleFactory.createVehicle("car");
        Vehicle truck = VehicleFactory.createVehicle("truck");

    truck = VehicleFactory.create_vehicle("truck")
    
    car.start()
    truck.start()
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, the Vehicle superclass provides the interface for creating
instances of Car and Truck, but the actual creation of those instances is
delegated to the respective subclasses. The client code can then call the
`createVehicle()` method on the appropriate subclass to create the desired
object.

Factory methods are useful in situations where the creation of objects is
complex, and the client code does not need to know the details of how the
objects are created. By providing an abstract interface for creating objects,
factory methods allow for greater flexibility and maintainability in the code.

## `toString()`

In Java, `toString()` is a method defined in the Object class that is inherited
by all classes in Java. It returns a string representation of an object. The
default implementation of `toString()` returns a string consisting of the class
name, the at-sign, and the object's hash code in hexadecimal form.

Classes can override the default `toString()` method to provide a more
meaningful string representation of an object. This can be useful for debugging
and logging purposes.

For example, consider the following Person class:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
public class Person {
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
    private int age;

    public Person(String firstName, String lastName, int age) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
        this.age = age;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return String.format("Name: %s %s, Age: %d", firstName, lastName, age);
    }
}

public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person person = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
    System.out.println(person.toString());
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

class Person {
private:
    string firstName;
    string lastName;
    int age;
public:
    Person(string firstName, string lastName, int age) {
        this->firstName = firstName;
        this->lastName = lastName;
        this->age = age;
    }

    string toString() {
        return "Name: " + firstName + " " + lastName + ", Age: " + to_string(age);
    }
};

int main() {
    Person person("John", "Doe", 30);
    cout << person.toString() << endl;
    return 0;
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, age):
        self.first_name = first_name
        self.last_name = last_name
        self.age = age
        
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Name: {self.first_name} {self.last_name}, Age: {self.age}"
    
person = Person("John", "Doe", 30)
print(person)
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, the `toString()` method is overridden to return a string
representation of a Person object that includes the person's name and age. This
can be useful for logging or printing the object to the console.

Note that we don't need to call `toString()` explicitly in most cases, as it is
automatically called when an object is printed to the console or concatenated
with a string.

## `equals()`

In object-oriented programming, ``equals()`` is a method that is commonly used
to compare two objects for equality. The equals method is used to check if two
objects have the same values for their attributes.

In Java, the equals method is a part of the Object class and can be overridden
in a subclass to define custom equality logic for the subclass. The equals
method takes an Object as a parameter and returns a boolean value. By default,
the equals method in the Object class checks if the two objects are the same
instance.

It is recommended to override the equals method when a custom class is created.
When overriding the equals method, the programmer should consider the following:

- **Symmetry**

  If `a.equals(b)` is true, then `b.equals(a)` should also be true.

  $$
  a = b \Rightarrow b = a
  $$
- **Reflexivity**

  `a.equals(a)` should always be true.

  $$
  a = a
  $$
- **Transitivity**

  If `a.equals(b)` and `b.equals(c)` are true, then `a.equals(c)` should also be
  true.

  $$
  a = b \land b = c \Rightarrow a = c
  $$
- **Consistency**

  The equals method should always return the same result for the same objects.
- **Null check**

  The equals method should return `false` if the object being compared is
  `null`.
