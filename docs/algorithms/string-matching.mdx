# Rabin-Karp String Matching Algorithm

Given `haystack` and `needle`, return `true` if `needle` is in the `haystack`.

We create a hash function for the sliding window s.t. the has is the sum of
the ascii values of the characters in the sliding window. As we progress, we
update the hash value while removing the first character and adding the last
character in the sliding window. If the hash value matches that of the haystack,
we check if the sliding window is indeed the haystack.
