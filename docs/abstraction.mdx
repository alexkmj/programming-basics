# Abstraction

**Abstraction** refers to the process of hiding complexity and focusing on
essential features of an object or system. There are several types of
abstraction in object-oriented programming. They include **data abstraction and
procedural abstraction**.

## Data Abstraction

**Data abstraction** refers to the process of hiding implementation details and
exposing only the relevant information to the user. In other words, data
abstraction is the process of representing complex data structures in a
simplified way, by defining a set of operations that can be performed on that
data without exposiong the underlying implementation.

:::tip
In Python, the ABC (Abstract Base Class) is a special class provided by the abc
module, which is used for defining abstract base classes. An abstract base class
is a class that cannot be instantiated directly, but can be used as a base class
for other classes.

In this example, we define an abstract class `Shape` with two abstract methods
`area()` and `paremiter()`. Any class that inherits from `Shape` must implement
these methods. This is an example of data abstraction, since we have defined a
high-level interface that does not expose the implementation details of each
shape.

We then define two concrete subclasses, `Rectangle` and `Circle`, that inherit
from `Shape` and implement the `area()` and `perimeter()` methods. Each subclass
has its own unique implementation of these methods that reflects the attributes
and behaviors of rectangles and circles.

By using data abstraction in this way, we can create a clean and well-defined
interface for working with different types of shapes, without exposing the
lower-level implementation details of each shape to the user.

## Procedural Abstraction

Also known as **Function Abstraction**.
This refers to the process of hiding the implementation details of a method or
function and exposing only its interface or signature. In other words, one
should only need to know what the method does and what arguments it takes,
without needing to understand how it works internally.

```java
public class Calculator {
    public static int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    public static int subtract(int a, int b) {
        return a - b;
    }
    
    public static int multiply(int a, int b) {
        return a * b;
    }
    
    public static double divide(double a, double b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Cannot divide by zero");
        }
        return a / b;
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a class `Calculator` which provides several methods
for performing basic arithmetic operations.

For example, the `add()` method takes two integers and returns their sum. The
user does not need to know how the addition was performed, only that the method
would return the correct result.
