# Assertions

Assertions in programming are statements that assert or check whether certain
conditions hold true or not. In other words, they are sanity checks that ensure
that assumptions made in code are valid during program execution.

In Java, assertions are implemented using the assert keyword. An assertion takes
a boolean expression and throws an `AssertionError` if it evaluates to false.
Assertions are often used to validate inputs, outputs, or intermediate states of
a program during development or testing.

Here is an example of how assertions can be used in Java:

```java
public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = -5;
        assert num > 0 : "Number is not positive";
        System.out.println("Number is positive");
    }
}
```

In this example, an assertion is used to check if the value of the num variable
is positive. If the assertion fails (i.e., num is not positive), an
`AssertionError` will be thrown with the message "Number is not positive".
Otherwise, the program will continue executing and print the message
"Number is positive".

It's worth noting that assertions can be disabled at runtime using the
`-disableassertions` or `-da` flag, so they should not be relied upon for
critical program logic or security checks.
