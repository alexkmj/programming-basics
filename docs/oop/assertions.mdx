# Assertions

Assertions in programming are statements that assert or check whether certain
conditions hold true or not. In other words, they are gatekeepers that ensure
that assumptions made in code are valid during program execution.

Assertions are implemented using the `assert` keyword. An assertion takes a
boolean expression and throws an `AssertionError` if it evaluates to false.
Assertions are often used to validate inputs, outputs, or intermediate states of
a program during development or testing.

## Example

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="java" label="Java">

```java
public class AssertExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        assert 5 == 5 : "left number neq right number"
        // This will error
        assert 5 == 10 : "left number neq right number"
        // Exception java.lang.AssertionError: left number neq right number
    }
}
```

:::info
It is worth noting that in order to enable assertions in jshell, one would need
to run `jshell` as `jshell -R -ea`.

Assertions can be disabled at runtime using the `-disableassertions` or `-da`
flag, so they should not be relied upon for critical program logic or security
checks.

  <TabItem value="cpp" label="C++">

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <cassert>

int main() {
    assert(5 == 5 && "left number neq right number");
    // This will error
    assert(5 == 10 && "left number neq right number");
    // This will throw an exception
    return 0;
}
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
assert 5 == 5, "left number neq right number"
# This will error
assert 5 == 10, "left number neq right number"
# AssertionError: left number neq right number
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

In this example, an assertion is used to check if the value on the left equals
the value on the right. If the assertion fails, an error would be thrown.
