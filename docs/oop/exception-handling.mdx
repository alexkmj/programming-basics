# Exception Handling

Exception handling is a mechanism in object-oriented programming that allows a
program to handle runtime errors andunexpected events that can occur during the
execution of a program. Exceptions are objects that represent errors, and they
can be thrown by code that detects an error condition. When an exception is
thrown, it is caught by a handler that can take appropriate actions, such as
logging an error message, displaying a warning to the user, or attempting to
recover from the error.

In Java, exceptions are handled through a try-catch block. The code that may
throw an exception is enclosed within a try block, and any exceptions that are
thrown are caught by one or more catch blocks. Each catch block specifies the
type of exception it can handle, and the code within the block is executed if an
exception of that type is thrown.

For example, consider the following Java code that reads a number from the user
and attempts to convert it to an integer:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
        String input = scanner.nextLine();
        try {
            int number = Integer.parseInt(input);
            System.out.println("The number is: " + number);
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            System.err.println("Invalid input: " + input);
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the `parseInt` method can throw a `NumberFormatException` if
the input string is not a valid integer. This exception is caught by the catch
block that follows the try block, and an error message is printed to the
console. Without exception handling, the program would crash if the user entered
an invalid input.

Exception handling is an important part of writing robust and reliable code, and
it allows programs to recover gracefully from errors instead of crashing or
behaving unpredictably.

# Throwing Exceptions

Throwing an exception in Java is a way of signaling that an error or exceptional
condition has occurred during the execution of a program. This can help improve
the robustness and reliability of the program by allowing the program to
gracefully handle errors and prevent them from causing the program to crash or
produce incorrect results.

To throw an exception in Java, you first need to create an instance of the
exception class that corresponds to the type of error you want to throw. For
example, to signal that a file could not be found, you would create an instance
of the `FileNotFoundException` class. You can then throw this exception using
the throw keyword followed by the exception object. Here's an example:

```java
public void readFile(String filename) throws FileNotFoundException {
    File file = new File(filename);
    if (!file.exists()) {
        throw new FileNotFoundException("File not found: " + filename);
    }
    // code to read file...
}
```

In this example, if the file does not exist, an instance of
`FileNotFoundException` is created with a message indicating the name of the
file that could not be found. This exception is then thrown using the throw
keyword. The throws keyword in the method signature indicates that the method
may throw this exception and that calling code must handle it accordingly.

When an exception is thrown, it interrupts the normal flow of execution and is
passed up the call stack until it is caught by an appropriate catch block or
until it reaches the top level of the program, at which point it will terminate
the program.

# Function Interfaces

In Java, a functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract
method. It is also known as a Single Abstract Method (SAM) interface. The
purpose of a functional interface is to provide a way to define a single
functionality that can be executed by lambda expressions.

Functional interfaces are used extensively in Java 8 and later versions for
lambda expressions, method references, and the Stream API. The use of functional
interfaces makes it possible to write concise and expressive code.

Here's an example of a functional interface in Java:

```java
@FunctionalInterface
public interface Converter<F, T> {
    T convert(F from);
}
```

In this example, the `Converter` interface has a single abstract method convert
that takes a parameter of type `F` and returns a value of type `T`. The
`@FunctionalInterface` annotation is used to indicate that this interface is a
functional interface.

Functional interfaces can be used with lambda expressions to provide an
implementation for the abstract method. Here's an example of how to use the
`Converter` interface with a lambda expression:

```java
Converter<String, Integer> converter = (from) -> Integer.valueOf(from);
Integer result = converter.convert("123");
System.out.println(result);    // Output: 123
```

In this example, a lambda expression is used to provide an implementation for
the convert method of the `Converter` interface. The lambda expression takes a
String as a parameter and returns an Integer.

Functional interfaces provide a simple and powerful way to write code that is
concise, expressive, and easy to read.
