# No More Null

"No More Null" is a programming paradigm that aims to reduce the use of `null`
references or `null` values in code. It's based on the idea that `null`
references can cause bugs and make code harder to understand and maintain,
especially in larger projects.

Instead of using `null` references, the "No More Null" paradigm suggests using
alternative solutions, such as:

## `Optional` types

`Optional` types are a way to represent values that may or may not be present.
They allow you to explicitly handle cases where a value may be missing, instead
of relying on null references.

## Null object pattern

**Null object pattern** is a design pattern that suggests using a special object
to represent the absence of a value. This object is designed to behave like a
real object, but it doesn't contain any data.

## Defensive programming

**Defensive programming** is a coding technique that involves anticipating and
handling potential errors and edge cases. This can include things like checking
for `null` references before using them, validating input, and adding error
handling code to catch and handle exceptions.

By adopting the "No More Null" paradigm, developers can write more reliable and
maintainable code, and reduce the likelihood of bugs caused by null references.
However, it requires a shift in mindset and a willingness to use alternative
solutions to handle cases where values may be missing.
