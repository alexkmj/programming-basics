# Immutability

**Immutability** is a concept in object-oriented programming where an object's
state cannot be changed after it is created.

Immutability ensures that the state of an object remains constant and cannot be
changed by any external entity. This can have several benefits:

- **Thread safety**

  Immutable objects are thread-safe because their state cannot be changed once
  they are created. This eliminates the need for synchronization, making the
  code simpler and more efficient.
- **Security**

  Immutable objects can be shared without the risk of being modified, which is
  important in security-sensitive applications.
- **Simplicity**

  Immutable objects are simpler to work with because their state cannot change.
  This makes them easier to understand, test, and maintain.
- **Predictability**

  Since an immutable object cannot be changed once it is created, it will
  always behave predictably. This can be particularly important in systems where
  predictability is critical, such as real-time systems.

```python
class ImmutablePerson:
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name):
        self._first_name = first_name
        self._last_name = last_name

    @property

```

:::info
In Python, `@property` is a decorator used to define "getter" methods for a
class attribute. It allows you to access a class attribute as if it were a
property of an object, without actually calling a method.
