# SOLID Principles

The SOLID principles are a set of guidelines for writing software that is easy
to understand, maintain, and extend. They were first introduced by Robert C.
Martin, and are widely used in object-oriented programming. The acronym "SOLID"
stands for:

- Single Responsibility Principle
- Open-Closed Principle
- Liskov Substitution Principle
- Interface Segregation Principle
- Dependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one
reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility.
This makes the class easier to understand, test, and maintain.

Suppose we have a class called `Order` that represents an order in an online
store. The class has a `calculateTotalPrice()` method, which calculates the
total price of the order. However, the `Order` class also has a `save()` method,
which saves the order to a database.

    public double calculateTotalPrice() {
        // calculate total price of the order
    }

    public void save() {
        // save the order to the database
    }
}
```

public:
    Order(std::vector<Item> items) {
        this->items = items;
    }

    double calculateTotalPrice() {
        // calculate total price of the order
    }

    void save() {
        // save the order to the database
    }
};

int main() {
    std::vector<Item> items;
    // Add items to the vector
    Order order(items);
    order.calculateTotalPrice();
    order.save();
    return 0;
}
```

  <TabItem value="python" label="Python">

```python
class Order:
    def __init__(self, items):
        self.items = items

    def calculateTotalPrice(self):
        # calculate total price of the order
        pass

    def save(self):
        # save the order to the database
        pass
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This violates the SRP, as the `Order` class
now has two responsibilities: calculating the total price and saving the order.
To fix this, we can create a separate class called `OrderRepository`, which is
responsible for saving orders to the database. The `Order` class can then
delegate the responsibility of saving the order to the `OrderRepository` class.

## Open-Closed Principle

The Open-Closed Principle states that a class should be open for extension but
closed for modification. In other words, we should be able to add new
functionality to a class without modifying its existing code.

:::danger wrong implementation

```java
public class Shape {
    public string type;

    public class Shape(String type) {
        this.type = type;
    }

    public void draw() {
        if (this.type == "Rectangle") {
            // draw a rectangle
        } else if (this.type == "Circle") {
            // draw a circle
        }
    }
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public class Circle() {
        this.super("Circle");
    }
}
```

In the above example, we cannot extend `Shape` without modifying `Shape`. This
violates the open-close principle.

:::

Suppose we have a class called `Shape` that represents a geometric shape. The
`Shape` class has a `draw()` method, which draws the shape. Now, suppose we want
to add a new type of shape called `Triangle`. We can create a new class called
`Triangle` that extends the `Shape` class and overrides the `draw()` method.

```java
public abstract class Shape {
    public abstract void draw();
}

public class Circle extends Shape {
    public void draw() {
        // draw a circle
    }
}

public class Square extends Shape {
    public void draw() {
        // draw a square
    }
}

public class Triangle extends Shape {
    public void draw() {
        // draw a triangle
    }
}

```

## Liskov Substitution Principle

The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be
able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness
of the program.

Suppose we have a class called `Bird` that represents a bird. The `Bird` class
has a `fly()` method, which allows the bird to fly. Now, suppose we have a
subclass of `Bird` called `Penguin`. Penguins cannot fly, so the `fly()` method
should be disabled for `Penguin` objects.

```java
public class Bird {
    public void fly() {
        // fly
    }
}

public class Penguin extends Bird {
    public void fly() {
        throw new UnsupportedOperationException("Penguins cannot fly");
    }
}
```

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) states that a client should not be
forced to depend on methods it does not use. In other words, interfaces should
be designed in such a way that they are specific to the needs of the client, and
not overly broad or general. Clients should only be required to implement the
methods that they need, and not be forced to implement unnecessary methods.

The goal of ISP is to make software more modular, flexible, and maintainable. By
creating smaller and more focused interfaces, it is easier to change and update
the software without affecting other parts of the system.

For example, consider an interface for a document processing system that
includes methods for editing, formatting, and printing documents. If a client
only needs to edit documents, they should not be required to implement the
formatting and printing methods. Instead, the interface should be split into
smaller, more focused interfaces, such as `EditableDocument` and
`PrintableDocument`, which can be implemented separately by different clients
depending on their needs.

Overall, ISP encourages software developers to design interfaces that are
focused, flexible, and easy to maintain, leading to better software design and
fewer unintended side effects when making changes to the system.

```java
// This interface represents a general document that can be printed
interface Document {
    void print();
}

// This interface represents a document that can be scanned
interface Scannable {
    void scan();
}

// This interface represents a document that can be copied
interface Copyable {
    void copy();
}

// This class represents a simple document that can be printed
class SimpleDocument implements Document {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing simple document");
    }
}

// This class represents a complex document that can be printed and scanned
class ComplexDocument implements Document, Scannable {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing complex document");
    }

    public void scan() {
        System.out.println("Scanning complex document");
    }
}

// This class represents a photocopier that can print, scan and copy documents
class Photocopier implements Document, Scannable, Copyable {
    public void print() {
        System.out.println("Printing document");
    }

    public void scan() {
        System.out.println("Scanning document");
    }

    public void copy() {
        System.out.println("Copying document");
    }
}
```

In this example, we have three interfaces (`Document`, `Scannable`, and
`Copyable`) that define different capabilities of documents. The
`SimpleDocument` class implements the `Document` interface, which means it can
be printed. The `ComplexDocument` class implements both the `Document` and
`Scannable` interfaces, which means it can be printed and scanned. Finally, the
`Photocopier` class implements all three interfaces, which means it can print,
scan and copy documents.

This design follows the Interface Segregation Principle because each interface
defines a single responsibility, and clients (such as the `Photocopier` class)
can choose which interfaces to implement based on their needs. This makes the
code more modular and flexible, and avoids forcing clients to implement
unnecessary methods.

## Dependency Inversion Principle

The Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) states that high-level modules should
not depend on low-level modules, but both should depend on abstractions.
`Abstractions` should not depend on details, but details should depend on
abstractions.

This principle suggests that instead of depending on specific implementations,
code should depend on abstractions or interfaces. This allows for greater
flexibility and easier maintenance, as the underlying implementation can be
changed without affecting the code that depends on it.

For example, consider a system that sends notifications to users through email,
SMS, or push notifications. Instead of implementing the notification sending
logic directly in a high-level module, the code should depend on an abstraction
or interface that defines the notification sending behavior. This allows for
easy addition or removal of notification methods without affecting the rest of
the codebase.

```java
// Notification interface
public interface Notification {
    public void sendNotification(String message);
}

// Email notification implementation
public class EmailNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        // Send email notification
    }
}

// SMS notification implementation
public class SmsNotification implements Notification {
    @Override
    public void sendNotification(String message) {
        // Send SMS notification
    }
}

// Notification sender
public class NotificationSender {
    private Notification notification;

    // Constructor injection
    public NotificationSender(Notification notification) {
        this.notification = notification;
    }

    public void send(String message) {
        notification.sendNotification(message);
    }
}

// Usage example
public static void main(String[] args) {
    NotificationSender sender = new NotificationSender(new EmailNotification());
    sender.send("New message!");

    sender = new NotificationSender(new SmsNotification());
    sender.send("New message!");
}
```

In this example, the `NotificationSender` class depends on the `Notification`
interface, rather than a specific implementation. This allows for easy swapping
of the underlying implementation without affecting the `NotificationSender`
code. The `Notification` interface defines a `sendNotification()` method, which
is implemented by the `EmailNotification` and `SmsNotification` classes. The
`NotificationSender` class is constructed with a specific implementation of the
`Notification` interface using constructor injection.
